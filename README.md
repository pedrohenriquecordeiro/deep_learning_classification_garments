## Project Description
A study for the development of a neural network model, with the objective of classifying garments contained in figures.

## Relevant Points
* Adam algorithm: method used to optimize model accuracy (stochastic downward gradient)
* Sparse Categorical Crossentropy: method used to calculate how much the model should seek to reduce losses (Categorical because the dataset is categorical)
* Underfitting and Overfitting: means to verify the occurrence and how to avoid
* Dropout: used regularization technique that directly modifies the network
* Kernel Initializer:
