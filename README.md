# Classification Project with Deep Learning 
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29979127/85621784-31eb0400-b63c-11ea-82ba-f591167f2441.png" width=400/>

## Project Description
<p align="justify"> 
    A study for the development of a neural network model, with the objective of classifying garments contained in figures.
</p>


## Relevant Points
:round_pushpin: Adam algorithm: method used to optimize model accuracy (stochastic downward gradient)

:round_pushpin: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy: method used to calculate how much the model should seek to reduce losses (Categorical because the dataset is categorical)

:round_pushpin: Underfitting and Overfitting: means to verify the occurrence and how to avoid

:round_pushpin: Dropout: used regularization technique that directly modifies the network

:round_pushpin: Learning Rate: testing how important the learning rate is in training the model
